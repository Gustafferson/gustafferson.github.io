During the transition to hybrid learning for the 2020-21 academic year, I volunteered to produce a series of videos for the Masters-level Geotechnical Modelling module provided by the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Nottingham.
I've uploaded a short explainer on why I volunteered, what I felt I could add, where to find the series, to the site.
You can find this in the side/header-bar, or by [using this link](https://pettey.co.uk/GeotechnicalModelling.html).
