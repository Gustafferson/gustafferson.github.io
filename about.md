## Doctorate
### <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #313131;"  name="PhDBegins"> Overview  </a>
My doctoral study started in October 2019 in the  [Nottingham Centre for Geomechanics (NCG)](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/nottingham-centre-for-geomechanics/index.aspx). 
The aim of my PhD is to investigate the behaviour of **soil-structure interfaces**, and improve the models engineers currently use to predict their behaviour.
**Interfaces** occur in every single civil engineering project on dry land. 
Rather oddly in respect of this fact, their behaviour is not widely understood, and vast amounts of resources are spent over-engineering their designs to stave off failure from wear over long periods of time.
A lack of full understanding of how the engineered world responds to wear can often [lead to catastrophe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Pl0rsVdXxM).

### 2020
* <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #515151;"  name="JournalPaper"> Writing the first journal paper of my doctorate. *Est. completion: Q3 2020* </a>
    - Working title: *A micromechanically driven analysis of soil-structure interface degradation*
    - Aims/Objectives: Following the publication of *Effect of Crushed Particles on Soil-Structure Interface Behaviour* at the 4th European Conference on Physical Modelling in Geotechnics, this paper seeks to develop a framework for the change in soil-structure interface behaviour over the course of thousands of shear displacements. 
    - Methods: I designed a novel testing apparatus for the shearing of a single particle, under similar conditions to the large samples tested on another apparatus within NCG. Using statistical modelling, surface profiling and image based shape characterisation of the single particle tests, a framework can be established for the global response.

  - Title: *Effect of Crushed Particles on Soil-Structure Interface Behaviour*
  - Aims/Objectives: When soil-structure interfaces are sheared over thousands of millimetres, the soil medium begins to break down, and the structure becomes heavily damaged. This paper marked the first identification of a sudden change in the stress state in the interface layer, and a global rearrangement in the soil skeleton which we referred to as *popcorning*. It is hypothesised that the sudden change is a result of a the crushing of grains in the interface layer. To test this hypothesis, traditional direct shear tests were conducted in the inverted orientation (rotated 180Â° to the horizontal).
  - Methods: It has been established that the relative roughness of interfaces is a crucial factor in their behaviour. As such, a frame was designed allowing for the inversion of the testing apparatus, before a series of tests were carried out. Data analysis produced novel insights into the interface's behaviour, for example the transition from a low to a high stress state occurs in tandem with an increase in the rate of contraction of the sample. 

## Career
### Overview
After commencing study of MEng Civil Engineering at the University of Nottingham in September 2015, I was fortunate enough to be offered sponsorship of my degree by VINCI Construction UK/Taylor Woodrow. 
This would involve me undertaking placement work in the Major Projects division each summer during my undergraduate degree studies.
During spells on the Crossrail Whitechapel, a joint venture between Balfour Beatty, Vinci and Morgan Sindall; Victoria Station Upgrade and M20 J10a projects, I very much enjoyed my time on the varied and challenging work of contracting on large civil engineering projects.
I managed to impress my line managers on the Whitechapel project enough to be invited back by Balfour Beatty in late summer 2018, to act as a graduate engineer during a staffing shortage.
By the end of 2018 I was offered the full position of Graduate Engineer by both Balfour Beatty and VINCI Construction UK/Taylor Woodrow.

On my return to my fourth and final year of undergraduate study, in persual of First Class Honours, I completed my individual project studying the behaviour of soil-structure interfaces with [Dr Charles Heron](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charles-heron-138768a6/?originalSubdomain=uk).
Through the duration of this project, my work (seemed to) impress the good Doctor, and I was offered a 3.5 year PhD studentship funded by Research Council UK.
At this point I had to make a career decison between engineering contracting and postgraduate study, ultimately deciding on the latter due to the greater challenge it represented. 
I hope to use the experience I've earned previously of problem solving and real-world application of engineering theory, to excel in my postgraduate study.

Postgraduate study represents a distinct opportunity to hone my problem solving, statistical/data analysis, and communication skills, that are becoming invaluable in the modern world. 
I believe the direction of problem solving and data analysis leads to only one destination, computationally driven analysis and machine learning.
With that, I have endevoured to learn the fundamentals of these processes and apply them through the use of Python.
It is my hope that these skills combined with my academic background will allow me to tackle any number of tasks in front of me.

## Skills/Activities
### Ongoing Projects
* Self learning Python & Machine Learning frameworks
  - Using my background in data analysis in MATLAB, I am teaching myself the lanaguage and frameworks of Python and its machine learning libraries. 
  - These skills will benefit my academic work and set up my ambitions to transition into the professional world on completion of postgraduate study.

* Training for an Olympic length Triathlon
  - Corona has taken away the end date I had in mind...
  - Following my retirement from hockey (it's a young man's game...) I have decided to put myself through hell and complete an Olympic length Triathlon before the end of 2020. Persistance and patience is the key...
